# This program prints configuration of TZ environment variable for BRT
# timezone. BRT is the main timezone in Brazil, and corresponds to the
# official time at BrasÃ­lia. This program uses a timezone database to
# automatically determine the end week for summer time period, which
# is variable in Brazil as of 2012. Despite being created for use with
# MinGW MSYS, this program is suitable for POSIX systems in general.
